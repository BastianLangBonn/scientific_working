abstract = {We consider learning in a Markov decision process where we are not explicitly given a reward function, but where instead we can observe an expert demonstrating the task that we want to learn to perform. This setting is useful in applications (such as the task of driving) where it may be difficult to write down an explicit reward function specifying exactly how different desiderata should be traded off. We think of the expert as trying to maximize a reward function that is expressible as a linear combination of known features, and give an algorithm for learning the task demonstrated by the expert. Our. algorithm is based on using "inverse reinforcement learning" to try to recover the unknown reward function. We show that our algorithm terminates in a small number of iterations, and that even though we may never recover the expert's reward function, the policy output by the algorithm will attain performance close to that of the expert, where here performance is measured with respect to the expert's unknown reward function.},

learn tasks from practice. Task-level learning can compensate for the
structural modeling errors of the robot's lower-level control systems

learning procedures-fixed-model learning and refined-model learning-on a
ball-throwing robot system. Both learning approaches refine the task

the intermediate variables separation the lower-level systems. The

Actions by embodied agents automatically generate training data for the learning mechanisms, so that a humanoid robot develops categorization autonomously. Cognitive capabilities of the humanoid robot are developmentally created, starting from abilities for detecting, segmenting, and recognizing objects. Such mature abilities are integrated with the deeper developmental learning mechanisms required to create those abilities out of the robot's physical experiences. This work presents strategies for learning task sequences and to recognize objects employed on such tasks from human-robot interaction cues. Learning strategies are also presented for the control of both oscillatory and non-oscillatory movements for the execution of these learned tasks.

Steinbuch and Taylor presented neural network designs to explicitly store training data and do nearest neighbor lookup in the early 1960s. In this paper their nearest neighbor network is augmented with a local model network, which fits a local model to a set of nearest neighbors. This network design is equivalent to a statistical approach known as locally weighted regression, in which a local model is formed to answer each query, using a weighted regression in which nearby points (similar experiences) are weighted more than distant points (less relevant experiences). We illustrate this approach by describing how it has been used to enable a robot to learn a difficult juggling task.},

We propose a method that improves the learning process by using additional data obtained from other experiments of the robot or even from experiments with different robot architectures. Incorporating experiences from other experiments requires transfer learning that has been used with success in machine learning. The proposed method can be used for arbitrary robot model, together with any type of learning algorithm.

A probability-based estimation of the relevance is suggested by first projecting the motion data onto a generic latent space using principal component analysis.

This provides a measure of the spatio-temporal correlations across the different modalities collected from the robot, which can be used to determine a metric of the imitation performance.

abstract = {In the past years, many authors have considered application of machine learning methodologies to effect robot learning by demonstration. Gaussian mixture regression (GMR) is one of the most successful methodologies used for this purpose. A major limitation of GMR models concerns automatic selection of the proper number of model states, i.e., the number of model component densities. Existing methods, including likelihood- or entropy-based criteria, usually tend to yield noisy model size estimates while imposing heavy computational requirements. Recently, Dirichlet process (infinite) mixture models have emerged in the cornerstone of nonparametric Bayesian statistics as promising candidates for clustering applications where the number of clusters is unknown a priori. Under this motivation, to resolve the aforementioned issues of GMR-based methods for robot learning by demonstration, in this paper we introduce a nonparametric Bayesian formulation for the GMR model, the Dirichlet process GMR model. We derive an efficient variational Bayesian inference algorithm for the proposed model, and we experimentally investigate its efficacy as a robot learning by demonstration methodology, considering a number of demanding robot learning by demonstration scenarios. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Robots trained on such demonstrations learn more quickly, perform more accurately and generalize better.

external coordinates requires computationally efficient solutions of the
inverse kinematics problem. In this context, this paper investigates
inverse kinematics learning for resolved motion rate control (RMRC)
employing an optimization criterion to resolve kinematic redundancies.
Our learning approach is based on the key observations that learning an
inverse of a nonuniquely invertible function can be accomplished by
augmenting the input representation to the inverse model and by using a
spatially localized learning approach. We apply this strategy to inverse
kinematics learning and demonstrate how a recently developed statistical
learning algorithm, locally weighted projection regression, allows
efficient learning of inverse kinematic mappings in an incremental
fashion even when input spaces become rather high dimensional. Our
results are illustrated with a 30-DOF humanoid robot},

Using the developed free gait generation algorithm the robot maintains to generate stable gaits according to the commanded velocity. The reinforcement learning scheme incorporated into the free gait generation makes the robot choose more stable states and develop a continuous walking pattern with a larger average stability margin. While walking in normal conditions with no external effects causing unstability, the robot is guaranteed to have stable walk, and the reinforcement learning only improves the stability. The adaptability of the learning scheme is tested also for the abnormal case of deficiency in one of the rear-legs. The robot gets a negative reinforcement when it falls, and a positive reinforcement when a stable transition is achieved. In this way the robot learns to achieve a continuous pattern of stable walk with five legs. The developed free gait generation with reinforcement learning is applied in real-time on the actual robot both for normal walking with different speeds and learning of five-legged walking in the abnormal case.

As an initial policy one can even take a manually coded behaviour and then improve it for example with reinforcement learning.

Experiments were carried out to investigate this hypothesis in a simulated learning robot. For this purpose, a non-symbolic emotion model was developed that takes the form of a recurrent artificial neural network where emotions both depend on and influence the perception of the state of the world. This emotion model was integrated in a reinforcement-learning architecture with three different roles: influencing perception, providing reinforcement value, and determining when to reevaluate decisions. Experiments to test and compare this emotion-dependent architecture with a more conventional architecture were done in the context of a solitary learning robot performing a survival task. This research led to the conclusion that artificial emotions are a useful construct to have in the domain of behavior-based autonomous agents with multiple goals and faced with an unstructured environment, because they provide a unifying way to tackle different issues of control, analogous to natural systems' emotions.},

Many current robot learning algorithms require the existence of basic behaviors that can be combined to perform the desired task.

In order to perform the task, the robot should learn to hold the table at a suitable position and then perform the lifting task cooperatively with the human. Accordingly, learning is split into two phases. The first phase enables the robot to reach out and hold one end of the table. A Programming by Demonstration (PbD) algorithm based on GMM/GMR is used to accomplish this. In the second phase the robot switches its role to an agent learning to collaborate with the human on the task. A guided reinforcement learning algorithm is developed.

The obvious enticement is that the robot should be able to improve its own behavior without the need for detailed step-by-step programming. However, for RL to reach its full potential, the algorithms must be sample efficient: they must learn competent behavior from very few real-world trials. From this perspective, model-based methods, which use experiential data more efficiently than model-free approaches, are appealing. But they often require exhaustive exploration to learn an accurate model of the domain. In this paper, we present an algorithm, Reinforcement Learning with Decision Trees (RL - DT that uses decision trees to learn the model by generalizing the relative effect of actions across states. The agent explores the environment until it believes it has a reasonable policy. The combination of the learning approach with the targeted exploration policy enables fast learning of the model.

abstract = {Many complex robot motor skills can be represented using elementary movements, and there exist efficient techniques for learning parametrized motor plans using demonstrations and self-improvement. However, in many cases, the robot currently needs to learn a new elementary movement even if a parametrized motor plan exists that covers a similar, related situation. Clearly, a method is needed that modulates the elementary movement through the meta-parameters of its representation. In this paper, we show how to learn such mappings from circumstances to
meta-parameters using reinforcement learning. We introduce an appropriate reinforcement learning algorithm based on a kernelized version of the reward-weighted regression. We compare this algorithm to several previous methods on a toy example and show that it performs well in comparison to standard algorithms. Subsequently, we show two robot applications of the presented setup; i.e., the generalization of throwing movements in darts, and of hitting movements in table tennis. We show that both tasks can be learned successfully using simulated and real robots.},

abstract = {Inexpensive personal robots will soon become available to a large portion of the population. Currently, most consumer robots are relatively simple single-purpose machines or toys. In order to be cost effective and thus widely accepted, robots will need to be able to accomplish a wide range of tasks in diverse conditions. Learning these tasks from demonstrations offers a convenient mechanism to customize and train a robot by transferring task related knowledge from a user to a robot. This avoids the time-consuming and complex process of manual programming. The way in which the user interacts with a robot during a demonstration plays a vital role in terms of how effectively and accurately the user is able to provide a demonstration. Teaching through demonstrations is a social activity, one that requires bidirectional communication between a teacher and a student. The work described in this paper studies how the user's visual observation of the robot and the robot's auditory cues affect the user's ability to teach the robot in a social setting. Results show that auditory cues provide important knowledge about the robot's internal state, while visual observation of a robot can hinder an instructor due to incorrect mental models of the robot and distractions from the robot's movements.},

abstract = {Grasping an object is a task that inherently needs to be treated in a hybrid fashion. The system must decide both where and how to grasp the object. While selecting where to grasp requires learning about the object as a whole, the execution only needs to reactively adapt to the context close to the grasp's location. We propose a hierarchical controller that reflects the structure of these two sub-problems, and attempts to learn solutions that work for both. A hybrid architecture is employed by the controller to make use of various machine learning methods that can cope with the large amount of uncertainty inherent to the task. The controller's upper level selects where to grasp the object using a reinforcement learner, while the lower level comprises an imitation learner and a vision-based reactive controller to determine appropriate grasping motions. The resulting system is able to quickly learn good grasps of a novel object in an unstructured environment, by executing smooth reaching motions and preshaping the hand depending on the object's geometry. The system was evaluated both in simulation and on a real robot. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The robot needs to solve three problems to be operated by free hand gestures: gesture (command) detection, action generation (related to the domain of the task) and association between gestures and actions. In this paper we propose a novel technique that allows the robot to solve these three problems together learning the action space, the command space, and their relations by just watching another robot operated by a human operator. The main technical contribution of this paper is the introduction of a novel algorithm that allows the robot to segment and discover patterns in its perceived signals without any prior knowledge of the number of different patterns, their occurrences or lengths. The second contribution is using a Ganger-causality based test to limit the search space for the delay between actions and commands utilizing their relations and taking into account the autonomy level of the robot. The paper also presents a feasibility study in which the learning robot was able to predict actor's behavior with 95.2\% accuracy after monitoring a single interaction between a novice operator and a WOZ operated robot representing the actor.},

The upper level learns a discrete sequence of sub-goals in a low-dimensional state space for achieving the main goal of the task. The lower-level modules learn local trajectories in the original high-dimensional state space to achieve the sub-goal specified by the upper level. We applied the hierarchical architecture to a three-link, two-joint robot for the task of learning to stand up by trial and error. The upper-level learning was implemented by Q-learning, while the lower-level learning was implemented by a continuous actor-critic method. The robot successfully learned to stand up within 750 trials in simulation and then in an additional 170 trials using real hardware.

In this paper, we take the task of learning table tennis as an example and present a new framework that allows a robot to learn cooperative table tennis from physical interaction with a human. The robot first learns a set of elementary table tennis hitting movements from a human table tennis teacher by kinesthetic teach-in, which is compiled into a set of motor primitives represented by dynamical systems. The robot subsequently generalizes these movements to a wider range of situations using our mixture of motor primitives approach. The resulting policy enables the robot to select appropriate motor primitives as well as to generalize between them. Finally, the robot plays with a human table tennis partner and learns online to improve its behavior. We show that the resulting setup is capable of playing table tennis using an anthropomorphic robot arm.},

Since infants' knowledge about the context is limited, which is comparable to robots, parents are supposed to properly guide their attention by emphasizing the important aspects of the action. Our analysis employing a bottom-up attention model revealed that motionese has the effects of highlighting the initial and final states of the action, indicating significant state changes in it, and underlining the properties of objects used in the action. Suppression and addition of parents' body movement and their frequent social signals to infants produced these effects. Our findings are discussed toward designing robots that can take advantage of parental teaching.},

In the robotics domain, task teaching has been mostly addressed by using only one or very few of these interactions. In this paper we present an approach for teaching robots that relies on the key features and the general approach people use when teaching each other: first give a demonstration, then allow the learner to refine the acquired capabilities by practicing under the teacher's supervision, involving a small number of trials. Depending on the quality of the learned task, the teacher may either demonstrate it again or provide specific feedback during the learner's practice trial for further refinement. Also, as people do during demonstrations, the teacher can provide simple instructions and informative cues, increasing the performance of learning. Thus, instructive demonstrations, generalization over multiple demonstrations and practice trials are essential features for a successful human-robot teaching approach. We implemented a system that enables all these capabilities and validated these concepts with a Pioneer 2DX mobile robot learning tasks from multiple demonstrations and teacher feedback.},

abstract = {Primates, in particular, humans are very adept at learning to use tools. In this talk, I will introduce a paradigm that utilizes this sensorimotor learning capacity to obtain robot behaviors, which otherwise would require manual programming by experts. The idea is to consider the target robotic platform as a tool that can be controlled by a human. Provided with an intuitive interface for controlling the robot, the human learns to perform a given task using the robot. This is akin to the stage where a beginner is learning to drive a car. After sufficient learning, the skilled control of the robot by the human provides learning data points that are used for constructing an autonomous controller so that the robot can perform the task without human guidance. I will demonstrate the feasibility of this framework by presenting several examples including a manipulation skill obtained for a robotic hand, and statically stable reaching skill obtained for a small humanoid robot. From an engineering point of view, this paradigm relies on techniques from teleoperation and machine learning, and has the same goals with robotic imitation and robot learning by demonstration. The key difference is that the proposed paradigm includes the human in the control loop and employs the human brain as the adaptive controller to accomplish a given task. Once the control proficiency has been attained by the human, then obtaining an autonomous controller boils down to reverse engineering the control policy established by the human brain. As time permits, I will present some ideas on the neural correlates of human-in-the-loop robot control and show how the interfaces built for robot skill synthesis can also be used in the reverse direction for probing motor control mechanisms employed by the central nervous system.},

abstract = {In a multi-agent system, action selection is important for the cooperation and coordination among agents. As the environment is dynamic and complex, modular Q-learning, which is one of the reinforcement learning schemes, is employed in assigning a proper action to an agent in the multi-agent system. The architecture of modular Q-learning consists of learning modules and a mediator module. The mediator module of the modular Q-learning system selects a proper action for the agent based on the Q-value obtained from each learning module. To obtain better performance, along with the Q-value, the mediator module also considers the state information in the action selection process. A uni-vector field is used for robot navigation. In the robot soccer environment, the effectiveness and applicability of modular Q-learning and the uni-vector field method are verified by real experiments using five micro-robots. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Designing effective behavioral controllers for mobile robots can be difficult and tedious; this process can be circumvented by using online learning techniques which allow robots to generate their own controllers online in an automated fashion. In multi-robot systems, robots operating in parallel can potentially learn at a much faster rate by sharing information amongst themselves. In this work, we use an adapted version of the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm in order to accomplish distributed online robotic learning in groups of robots with access to only local information. The effectiveness of the learning technique on a benchmark task (generating high-performance obstacle avoidance behavior) is evaluated for robot groups of various sizes, with the maximum group size allowing each robot to individually contain and manage a single PSO particle. To increase the realism of the technique, different PSO neighborhoods based on limitations of real robotic communication are tested and compared in this scenario. We explore the effect of varying communication power for one of these communication-based PSO neighborhoods. To validate the effectiveness of these learning techniques, fully distributed online learning experiments are run using a group of 10 real robots, generating results which support the findings from our simulations.},

They extract initial biases as well as strategies how to approach a learning problem from instructions and/or demonstrations of other humans. For learning control, this paper investigates how learning from demonstration can be applied in the context of reinforcement learning. We consider priming the Q-function, the value function, the policy, and the model of the task dynamics as possible areas where demonstrations can speed up learning. In general nonlinear learning problems, only model-based rein- forcement learning shows significant speed-up after a demonstration, while in the special case of linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problems, all methods profit from the demonstration. In an implementation of pole balancing on a complex anthropomorphic robot arm, we demonstrate that, when facing the complexities of real signal processing, model-based reinforcement learning offers the most robustness for LQR problems. Using the suggested methods, the robot learns pole balancing in just a single trial after a 30 second long demonstration of the human instructor.},

Research on mobile robot navigation has produced two major paradigms for mapping indoor environments: grid-based and topological. While grid-based methods produce accurate metric maps, their complexity often prohibits efficient planning and problem solving in large-scale indoor environments. Topological maps, on the other hand, can be used much more efficiently, yet accurate and consistent topological maps are often difficult to learn and maintain in large-scale environments, particularly if momentary sensor data is highly ambiguous. This paper describes an approach that integrates both paradigms: grid-based and topological. Grid-based maps are learned using artificial neural networks and naive Bayesian integration. Topological maps are generated on top of the grid-based maps, by partitioning the latter into coherent regions. By combining both paradigms, the approach presented here gains advantages from both worlds: accuracy/consistency and efficiency.

From July 2007, a single surgeon performed 63 robotic prostatectomies using the same operative technique. Perioperative data, including pathological and early functional results of the patient, were collected prospectively and analyzed. Along with the accumulation of the cases, the total operative time, setup time, console time and blood loss were significantly decreased. No major complication was present in any patient. Transfusion was needed in six patients; all of them were within the initial 15 cases. The positive surgical margin rate was 9.8\% (5/51) in pT2 disease. The most frequent location of positive margin in this stage was the lateral aspect (60\%), but in pT3 disease multiple margins were the most frequent (41.7\%). Overall, 53 (84.1\%) patients had totally continent status and the median time to continence was 6.56 weeks. Among 17 patients who maintained preoperative sexual activity (Sexual Health Inventory for Men >/= 17), stage below pT2, followed up for > 6 months with minimally one side of neurovascular bundle preservation procedure, 12 (70.6\%) were capable of intercourse postoperatively, and the mean time for sexual intercourse after operation was 5.7 months. In this series, robotic prostatectomy was a feasible and reproducible technique, with a short learning curve and low perioperative complication rate. Even during the initial phase of the learning curve, satisfactory results were obtained with regard to functional and oncological outcome.Asian Journal of Andrology (2009) 11: 167-175. doi: 10.1038/aja.2008.52; published online 19 January 2009.},

abstract = {Abstract We address the problem of learning robot control by model-free reinforcement learning (RL). We adopt the probabilistic model for model-free RL of Vlassis and Toussaint (Proceedings of the international conference on machine learning, Montreal, Canada, 2009), and we propose a Monte Carlo EM algorithm (MCEM) for control learning that searches directly in the space of controller parameters using information obtained from randomly generated robot trajectories. MCEM is related to, and generalizes, the PoWER algorithm of Kober and Peters (Proceedings of the neural information processing systems, 2009). In the finite-horizon case MCEM reduces precisely to PoWER, but MCEM can also handle the discounted infinite-horizon case. An interesting result is that the infinite-horizon case can be viewed as a randomized version of the finite-horizon case, in the sense that the length of each sampled trajectory is a random draw from an appropriately constructed geometric distribution. We provide some preliminary experiments demonstrating the effects of fixed (PoWER) vs randomized (MCEM) horizon length in two simulated and one real robot control tasks.},

@article{Wang2008,
abstract = {This paper presents a machine-learning approach to the multi-robot coordination problem in an unknown dynamic environment. A multi-robot object transportation task is employed as the platform to assess and validate this approach. Specifically, a flexible two-layer multi-agent architecture is developed to implement multi-robot coordination. In this architecture, four software agents form a high-level coordination subsystem while two heterogeneous robots constitute the low-level control subsystem. Two types of machine learning-reinforcement learning (RL) and genetic algorithms (GAs)-are integrated to make decisions when the robots cooperatively transport an object to a goal location while avoiding obstacles. A probabilistic arbitrator is used to determine the winning output between the RL and GA algorithms. In particular, a modified RL algorithm called the sequential Q-learning algorithm is developed to deal with the issues of behavior conflict that arise in multi-robot cooperative transportation tasks. The learning-based high-level coordination subsystem sends commands to the low-level control subsystem, which is implemented with a hybrid force/position control scheme. Simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptivity of the developed approach. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Learning by multimodal observation of vision and language offers a potentially powerful paradigm for robot learning. Recent experiments have shown that 'mirror' neurons are activated when an action is being performed, perceived, or verbally referred to. Different input modalities are processed by distributed cortical neuron ensembles for leg, arm and head actions. In this overview paper we consider this evidence from mirror neurons by integrating motor, vision and language representations in a learning robot. Â© 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Yang2004,
abstract = {Multiagent reinforcement learning for multi- robot systems is a challenging issue in both robotics and artificial intelligence. With the ever increasing interests in theoretical researches and practical applications, currently there have been a lot of efforts towards providing some solutions to this challenge. However, there are still many difficulties in scaling up the multiagent reinforcement learning to multi-robot systems. The main objective of this paper is to provide a survey, though not completely on the multiagent reinforcement learning in multi-robot systems. After reviewing important advances in this field, some challenging problems and promising research directions are analyzed. A concluding remark is made from the perspectives of the authors. I.},
