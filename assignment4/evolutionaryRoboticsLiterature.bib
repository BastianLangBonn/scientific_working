abstract = {Purpose – This paper aims to describe an integrated hardware/software system based on evolutionary robotics and its application in an edutainment context. Design/methodology/approach – The system is based on a wide variety of artificial life techniques (artificial neural networks, genetic algorithms, user-guided evolutionary design and evolutionary robotics). A user without any computer programming skill can determine the robot's behavior in two different ways: artificial breeding or artificial evolution. Breedbot has been used as a didactic tool in teaching evolutionary biology and as a “futuristic” toy by several science centers. The digital side of Breedbot can be downloaded on the web site: www.isl.unina.it/breedbot Findings – The results in this pilot study suggest that using Breedbot in an educational context can be useful to improve learning in biology. Research limitations/implications – As this is a pilot study, one limitation is the small sample considered. The issue will be investigated further with a wider population and subject-matter, which will also improve the Breedbot system. Practical implications – These results suggest that tools like Breedbot could be introduced into biology curricula at schools. Originality/value – The paper describes an original application in digital content and shows the importance of using such a tool in an Edutainment context. It is therefore interesting for teachers, vocational trainers and anyone involved in educational activities. - See more at: http://0-www.emeraldinsight.com.library.ada.edu.az/journals.htm?issn=0264-0473\&volume=26\&issue=3\&articleid=1728646\&show=abstract\#sthash.5hgSi1XK.dpuf},

abstract = {The SYMBRION project stands at the crossroads of artificial life and evolutionary robotics: a swarm of real robots undergoes online evolution by exchanging information in a decentralized Evolutionary Robotics Scheme: the diffusion of each individual's genotype depends both on its ability to survive in an unknown environment as well as its ability to maximize mating opportunities during its lifetime, which suggests an implicit fitness. This paper presents early research and prospective ideas in the context of large-scale swarm robotics projects, focusing on the open-ended evolutionary approach in the SYMBRION project. One key issue of this work is to perform on-board evolution in a spatially distributed population of robots. A real-world experiment is also described which yields important considerations regarding open-ended evolution with real autonomous robots.},

More specifically, the paper describes a novel approach where the usual concepts of population, generations and fitness are made implicit in the system. Individuals co-evolve embedded in their environment. Exploiting the self-assembling capabilities of the (simulated) robots, the genotype of a successful individual can spread in the population. In this way, interesting behaviours emerge spontaneously, resulting in chasing and evading other individuals, collective obstacle avoidance and co-ordinated motion of self-assembled structures.},

Actuators for generating motion in articulated joints are key components of any robot and a vast range of compact, low cost devices are available, but their behavior is based on generating positions and velocities by ironing out perturbations. In simulation it is easy to create variable compliance actuation schemes where damping and spring forces used to guide motion can be subject to evolutionary search and aid the generation of efficient adaptive behavior. We present an experimental design for a cost effective actuator module with software controlled compliance that can approximate arbitrary mechanical spring damping systems, with parameters that are software configurable at run time. The benefits of this software controlled compliance and the versatility of our embedded control system are demonstrated in a minimal walking robot. The potential value and inherent limitations of this device as a tool for evolutionary robotics, where software controlled compliant properties can form part of an evolutionary search, and in the wider field of autonomous robotics, are discussed.},

abstract = {Methodologies are emerging in many branches of computer science that demonstrate how human users and automated algorithms can collaborate on a problem such that their combined solutions outperform those produced by either humans or algorithms alone. The problem of behavior optimization in robotics seems particularly well-suited for this approach because humans have intuitions about how animals—and thus robots—should and should not behave, and can visually detect non-optimal behaviors that are trapped in local optima. Here we introduce a multiobjective approach in which a surrogate user (which stands in for a human user) deflects search away from local optima and a traditional fitness function eventually leads search toward the global optimum. We show that this approach produces superior solutions for a deceptive robotics problem compared to a similar search method that is guided by just a surrogate user or just a fitness function.},

However, a major drawback of this approach relies in the difficulty to define the fitness function (i.e. the learning setup) in order to get satisfying results. Recent works addressed this issue either by decomposing the learning task or by endowing the agent with such capabilities that should make the goal easier to achieve. Literature in evolutionary approach shows that modifying the very nature of genetic operators and/or fitness during the course of evolution may lead to better results for complex problems.

In particular, Continuous Time Recurrent Neural Networks (CTRNNs) are evolved for odor source localization in simulated turbulent odor plumes. In the experiments, the simulated robot is equipped with a single chemical sensor and a wind direction sensor. Three main contributions are made. First, it is shown that the ER approach can be successfully applied to odor source localization in both low-turbulent and high-turbulent conditions. Second, it is demonstrated that a small neural network is able to successfully perform all three sub-tasks of odor source localization: (i) finding the odor plume, (ii) moving toward the odor source, and (iii) identifying the odor source. Third, the analysis of the evolved behaviors reveals two novel odor source localization strategies. These strategies are successfully re-implemented as finite state machines, validating the insights from the analysis of the neural controllers. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The proposed approach considers the entropy of the sensori-motor stream generated by the robot controller. This entropy is computed using unsupervised learning; its maximization, achieved by an on-board evolutionary algorithm, implements a "curiosity instinct", favouring controllers visiting many diverse sensori-motor states (sms). Further, the set of sms discovered by an individual can be transmitted to its offspring, making a cultural evolution mode possible. Cumulative entropy (computed from ancestors and current individual visits to the sms) defines another self-driven fitness; its optimization implements a "discovery instinct", as it favours controllers visiting new or rare sensori-motor states.

abstract = {In Evolutionary Robotics (ER), explicitly rewarding for behavioral diversity recently revealed to generate efficient results without recourse to complex fitness functions. The principle of such approaches is to explicitly encourage diversity in the robot behavior space instead of in the space of genotypes (the space explored by the evolutionary algorithm) or the space of phenotypes (the space of robot controllers and morphologies). To implement such approaches, a similarity between behaviors needs to be evaluated but, up to now, used similarity measures are problem-specific. The goal of this work is to explore generic behavioral similarity measures that only rely on sensori-motor values. With such a measure, we managed to evolve the topology and the parameters of neuro-controllers that make a simulated robot go towards a ball, take it, find a basket, put the ball into the basket, perform a half-turn, search and take another ball, put it into the basket, etc. In this experiment, two objectives were simultaneously optimized with NSGA-II: the number of collected balls and the generic behavioral diversity objective. Several generic behavioral measures are compared. To confirm the interpretation of behavioral diversity objective and in an attempt to characterize behavioral similarity measures, they are also compared to human-made behavioral similarity evaluations. They reveal to classify behaviors globally as humans did, but with no clear correlation between the closeness to human classification and the efficiency within an evolutionary run.},

In the first case we suggest framework to describe fitness functions, choose them according to the situation constraints, and compare available experiments in the literature on evolutionary robotics. In the second case, we suggest way to make experimental results applicable to real- world situations by evolving online continuous adaptive controllers. We also give an overview of recent experimental results showing that the suggested approaches pro- duce qualitatively superior abilities, scale up to more complex architectures, smoothly transfer from simulations to real robots and across different robotic platforms, and autonomously adapt in few seconds to several sources of strong variability that were not included during the evolutionary run.},

It allows to control both, a single robot as well a set of cooperating modules in multi-modular reconfigurable robotics. Our approach is inspired by chemical signal-processing and hormone control in animals. Evolutionary computation is used to adapt controllers for two distinct morphological robot configurations (uni-and multi-modular), different environmental conditions, and tasks. This approach is compared to artificial neural networks. Our results indicate, that the proposed control paradigm is well adaptable to different robot morphologies and to different environmental situations. It is able to generate behaviors for several robotic tasks and outperforms neural networks in terms of evolvability in the tested multi-modular robotic setting tested.},

abstract = {For several years now, various researchers have endeavored to apply artificial evolution to the automatic design of control systems for real robots. One of the major challenges they face concerns the question of how to assess the fitness of evolving controllers when each evolutionary run typically involves hundreds of thousands of such assessments. This article outlines new ways of thinking about and building simulations upon which such assessments can be performed. It puts forward sufficient conditions for the successful transfer of evolved controllers from simulation to reality and develops a potential methodology for building simulations in which evolving controllers are forced to satisfy these conditions if they are to be reliably fit. It is hypothesized that as long as simulations are built according to this methodology, it does not matter how inaccurate or incomplete they are: Controllers that have evolved to be reliably fit in simulation still will transfer into reality. Two sets of experiments are reported, both of which involve minimal look-up table-based simulations built according to these guidelines. In the first set, controllers were evolved that allowed a Khepera robot to perform a simple memory task in the real world. In the second set, controllers were evolved for the Sussex University gantry robot that were able to distinguish visually a triangle from a square, under extremely noisy real-world conditions, and to steer the robot toward the triangle. In both cases, controllers that were reliably fit in simulation displayed extremely robust behavior when downloaded into reality. 10.1177/105971239700600205},

abstract = {For several years now, various researchers have endeavoured to apply artificial evolution to the automatic design of control systems for robots. One of the major challenges they face is how the fitness of evolving controllers should be tested when each evolutionary run typically involves hundreds of thousands of such assessments. This thesis puts forward new techniques for evolving control systems for real robots using easy-to-build, fast-running simulations. It begins with a tutorial in state-of-the-art Evolutionary Robotics and discusses the best types of neural network, encoding scheme, genetic algorithm and genetic operators to use - and how to use them. Several novel types are introduced, and their relative merits over previous approaches are discussed. After analysing the conditions that must be met by controllers if they are to perform the same behaviour in reality as they do in simulation, a new methodology is proposed for building minimal simulations within which controllers that meet these conditions will successfully transfer into reality. Techniques are then put forward for forcing controllers that evolve to be reliably fit within such minimal simulations to meet these conditions. Four sets of experiments are reported, all involving minimal simulations. Controllers were evolved for a small mobile robot that could solve a T-maze in response to a light cue, target recognition and approach behaviours were evolved for a visually guided mobile robot, walking and obstacle-avoiding behaviours were evolved for an eight-legged robot and motion-tracking behaviours were evolved for a simple panning camera head. In all four cases, the evolution of complex robot behaviours that would have taken many months to evolve if fitness evaluations had been performed in reality was performed in a matter of hours, and controllers that evolved to be reliably fit in simulation displayed extremely robust behaviour when downloaded into reality.},

It has been suggested that carefully validated simulations with a proper treatment of noise may overcome these problems. This paper reports the results of experiments intended to test some of these claims. A simulation was constructed of a two-wheeled Khepera robot with IR and ambient light sensors. This included detailed mathematical models of the robot-environment interaction dynamics with empirically determined parameters. Artificial evolution was used to develop recurrent dynamical network controllers for the simulated robot, for obstacle-avoidance and light-seeking tasks, using different levels of noise in the simulation. The evolved controllers were down-loaded onto the real robot and the correspondence between behaviour in simulation and in reality was tested. The level of correspondence varied according to how much noise was used in the simulation, with very good results achieved when realistic quantities were applied. It has been demonstrated that it is possible to develop successful robot controllers in simulation that generate almost identical behaviours in reality, at least for a particular class of robot-environment interaction dynamics.},

We propose in this paper that there is one substantial difference between developmental robotics and epigenetic robotics, since epigenetic robotics concentrates primarily on modeling the development of cognitive elements of living systems in robotic systems, such as language, emotion, and social skills, while developmental robotics should also cover the modeling of neural and morphological development in single- and multirobot systems. With the recent rapid advances in evolutionary developmental biology and systems biology, increasing genetic and cellular principles underlying biological morphogenesis have been revealed. These principles are helpful not only in understanding biological development, but also in designing self-organizing, self-reconfigurable, and self-repairable engineered systems. In this paper, we propose morphogenetic robotics, an emerging new field in developmental robotics, is an important part of developmental robotics in addition to epigenetic robotics. By morphogenetic robotics, we mean a class of methodologies in robotics for designing self-organizing, self-reconfigurable, and self-repairable single- or multirobot systems, using genetic and cellular mechanisms governing biological morphogenesis.

Evolutionary Robotics is a self-adaptation approach which has been shown to e effectively find robot controllers for behaviors which are hard to implement by hand. There, evolvability is highly dependent on controller representation during evolution. It is known that using a genotypic controller representation which also encodes parts of the genotype-phenotype mapping (GPM) can lead to a meta-adaptation of the evolutionary operators to the search space structure, thus improving evolvability. We enhance this idea using a fully flexible GPM which is represented in the same way as the behavioral controllers are, and, therefore, can be completely evolved along with the behavior. The approach is based on finite state machines and extends an existing framework for decentralized evolution of robot behavior in swarms of mobile robots. Experiments indicate that the evolvable GPM outperforms both the extensively improved operators of the existing framework and a standard operator for the new real-valued genotypes with fixed GPM.},

abstract = {The reality gap, which often makes controllers evolved in simulation inefficient once transferred onto the physical robot, remains a critical issue in evolutionary robotics (ER). We hypothesize that this gap highlights a conflict between the efficiency of the solutions in simulation and their transferability from simulation to reality: the most efficient solutions in simulation often exploit badly modeled phenomena to achieve high fitness values with unrealistic behaviors. This hypothesis leads to the transferability approach, a multiobjective formulation of ER in which two main objectives are optimized via a Pareto-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm: 1) the fitness; and 2) the transferability, estimated by a simulation-to-reality (STR) disparity measure. To evaluate this second objective, a surrogate model of the exact STR disparity is built during the optimization. This transferability approach has been compared to two reality-based optimization methods, a noise-based approach inspired from Jakobi's minimal simulation methodology and a local search approach. It has been validated on two robotic applications: 1) a navigation task with an e-puck robot; and 2) a walking task with a 8-DOF quadrupedal robot. For both experimental setups, our approach successfully finds efficient and well-transferable controllers only with about ten experiments on the physical robot.},

abstract = {The reality gap, that often makes controllers evolved in simulation inefficient once transferred onto the real system, remains a critical issue in Evolutionary Robotics (ER); it prevents ER application to real-world problems. We hypothesize that this gap mainly stems from a conflict between the efficiency of the solutions in simulation and their transferability from simulation to reality: best solutions in simulation often rely on bad simulated phenomena (e.g. the most dynamic ones). This hypothesis leads to a multi-objective formulation of ER in which two main objectives are optimized via a Pareto-based Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm: (1) the fitness and (2) the transferability. To evaluate this second objective, a simulation-to-reality disparity value is approximated for each controller. The proposed method is applied to the evolution of walking controllers for a real 8-DOF quadrupedal robot. It successfully finds efficient and well-transferable controllers with only a few experiments in reality.},

abstract = {Evolutionary Robotics is a collection of heuristics where robotic control systems are developed by following the example of natural evolution. An evolutionary run is performed by mutating the robots' controllers randomly and selecting for some desired behavioral properties. Overall, these properties should be improved over time leading to a stable increase of fitness. However, random mutations on critical controller parts can lead to a rapid degradation lowering the performance of evolution. This paper presents an approach to reduce the loss of desirable behavior during an evolution process. A notion of age is introduced as a quality criterion to indicate the contribution of parts of a controller to the robot's overall behavior. To preserve the behavior evolved so far, mutations are channeled to affect controller parts with a lower age more than those with a higher age. As a result, controller parts that contribute to a good behavior are stabilized and the evolved desirable behavior is maintained. Experiments have been performed in a decentralized online evolutionary scenario with controllers based on finite state machines (FSMs). The results show an improvement in the number of successful evolutions and the number of successfully evolved robots compared to previous studies.},

abstract = {Evolutionary robotics (ER) aims at automatically designing robots or controllers of robots without having to describe their inner workings. To reach this goal, ER researchers primarily employ phenotypes that can lead to an infinite number of robot behaviors and fitness functions that only reward the achievement of the task-and not how to achieve it. These choices make ER particularly prone to premature convergence. To tackle this problem, several papers recently proposed to explicitly encourage the diversity of the robot behaviors, rather than the diversity of the genotypes as in classic evolutionary optimization. Such an approach avoids the need to compute distances between structures and the pitfalls of the noninjectivity of the phenotype/behavior relation; however, it also introduces new questions: how to compare behavior? should this comparison be task specific? and what is the best way to encourage diversity in this context? In this paper, we review the main published approaches to behavioral diversity and benchmark them in a common framework. We compare each approach on three different tasks and two different genotypes. The results show that fostering behavioral diversity substantially improves the evolutionary process in the investigated experiments, regardless of genotype or task. Among the benchmarked approaches, multi-objective methods were the most efficient and the generic, Hamming-based, behavioral distance was at least as efficient as task specific behavioral metrics.},

To sample the course of evolution, controllers were taken from progressively more advanced generations, and were then tested in a novel environment. Developments and changes in the controllers' abilities and competencies were identified and correlated with overall controller fitness.

abstract = {This paper presents results generated with a new evolutionary robotics (ER) simulation environment and its complementary real mobile robot colony research test-bed. Neural controllers producing mobile robot maze searching and exploration behaviors using binary tactile sensors as inputs were evolved in a simulated environment and subsequently transferred to and tested on real robots in a physical environment. There has been a considerable amount of proof-of-concept and demonstration research done in the field of ER control in recent years, most of which has focused on elementary behaviors such as object avoidance and homing. Artificial neural networks (ANN) are the most commonly used evolvable controller paradigm found in current ER literature. Much of the research reported to date has been restricted to the implementation of very simple behaviors using small ANN controllers. In order to move beyond the proof-of-concept stage our ER research was designed to train larger more complicated ANN controllers, and to implement those controllers on real robots quickly and efficiently. To achieve this a physical robot test-bed that includes a colony of eight real robots with advanced computing and communication abilities was designed and built. The real robot platform has been coupled to a simulation environment that facilitates the direct wireless transfer of evolved neural controllers from simulation to real robots (and vice versa). We believe that it is the simultaneous development of ER computing systems in both the simulated and the physical worlds that will produce advances in mobile robot colony research. Our simulation and training environment development focuses on the definition and training of our new class of ANNs, networks that include multiple hidden layers, and time-delayed and recurrent connections. Our physical mobile robot design focuses on maximizing computing and communications power while minimizing robot size, weight, and energy usage. The simulation and ANN-evolution environment was developed using MATLAB. To allow for efficient control software portability our physical evolutionary robots (EvBots) are equipped with a PC-104-based computer running a custom distribution of Linux and connected to the Internet via a wireless network connection. In addition to other high-level computing applications, the mobile robots run a condensed version of MATLAB, enabling ANN controllers evolved in simulation to be transferred directly onto physical robots without any alteration to the code. This is the first paper in a series to be published cataloging our results in this field.},

abstract = {This paper surveys fitness functions used in the field of evolutionary robotics (ER). Evolutionary robotics is a field of research that applies artificial evolution to generate control systems for autonomous robots. During evolution, robots attempt to perform a given task in a given environment. The controllers in the better performing robots are selected, altered and propagated to perform the task again in an iterative process that mimics some aspects of natural evolution. A key component of this process-one might argue, the key component-is the measurement of fitness in the evolving controllers. ER is one of a host of machine learning methods that rely on interaction with, and feedback from, a complex dynamic environment to drive synthesis of controllers for autonomous agents. These methods have the potential to lead to the development of robots that can adapt to uncharacterized environments and which may be able to perform tasks that human designers do not completely understand. In order to achieve this, issues regarding fitness evaluation must be addressed. In this paper we survey current ER research and focus on work that involved real robots. The surveyed research is organized according to the degree of a priori knowledge used to formulate the various fitness functions employed during evolution. The underlying motivation for this is to identify methods that allow the development of the greatest degree of novel control, while requiring the minimum amount of a priori task knowledge from the designer. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Evolutionary robotics (ER) is a field of research that applies artificial evolution toward the automatic design and synthesis of intelligent robot controllers. The preceding decade saw numerous advances in evolutionary robotics hardware and software systems. However, the sophistication of resulting robot controllers has remained nearly static over this period of time. Here, we make the case that current methods of controller fitness evaluation are primary factors limiting the further development of ER. To address this, we define a form of fitness evaluation that relies on intra-population competition. In this research, complex neural networks were trained to control robots playing a competitive team game. To limit the amount of human bias or know-how injected into the evolving controllers, selection was based on whether controllers won or lost games. The robots relied on video sensing of their environment, and the neural networks required on the order of 150 inputs. This represents an order of magnitude increase in sensor complexity compared to other research in this field. Evolved controllers were tested extensively in real fully-autonomous robots and in simulation. Results and experiments are presented to characterize the training process and the acquisition of controller competency under different evolutionary conditions. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

While robotics has concentrated so far on the first type of interactions (external robotics), to understand the behaviour of organisms more adequately we also need to reproduce in robots the inside of the body of organisms and to study the interactions of the robot's control system with what is inside the body (internal robotics). In this paper, seven differences between the two types of interactions are discussed and some examples of internal robotics are briefly described: robots that evolve a biological clock that allows them to look for food during the day and to rest at night; robots that evolve a pain signal associated with some damage in their body that allows the robot to stop moving when ill in order to recover more quickly from the bodily damage; and robots that can be hungry and/or thirsty and respond adaptively or maladaptively to conflicts between these two motivations.},

We believe that the most recent improvements to the state of the art now permit the investigation of this domain. For demonstrating this point, two different evolutionary computer simulation models are presented in this article. The first model, which uses a simplified 2D test environment, has resulted in controllers evolved with the following capabilities: (1) navigation through unknown environments, (2) obstacle-avoidance, (3) tracking of a movable target, and (4) execution of cooperative and coordinated behaviors based on implicit communication strategies. In order to improve the robustness of these results and their potential use in real MAV teams, a more sophisticated 3D model is presented herein. The results obtained so far using the two models demonstrate the feasibility of the chosen approach for further research on the design of autonomous controllers for MAVs. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {To understand the evolution of bipedalism among the hominoids in an ecological context we need to be able to estimate the energetic cost of locomotion in fossil forms. Ideally such an estimate would be based entirely on morphology since, except for the rare instances where footprints are preserved, this is the only primary source of evidence available. In this paper we use evolutionary robotics techniques (genetic algorithms, pattern generators and mechanical modeling) to produce a biomimetic simulation of bipedalism based on human body dimensions. The mechanical simulation is a seven-segment, two-dimensional model with motive force provided by tension generators representing the major muscle groups acting around the lower-limb joints. Metabolic energy costs are calculated from the muscle model, and bipedal gait is generated using a finite-state pattern generator whose parameters are produced using a genetic algorithm with locomotor economy (maximum distance for a fixed energy cost) as the fitness criterion. The model is validated by comparing the values it generates with those for modern humans. The result (maximum efficiency of 200 J m(-1)) is within 15\% of the experimentally derived value, which is very encouraging and suggests that this is a useful analytic technique for investigating the locomotor behaviour of fossil forms. Initial work suggests that in the future this technique could be used to estimate other locomotor parameters such as top speed. In addition, the animations produced by this technique are qualitatively very convincing, which suggests that this may also be a useful technique for visualizing bipedal locomotion.},

abstract = {Evolutionary robotics is a branch of artificial intelligence concerned with the automatic generation of autonomous robots. Usually the form of the robot is predefined and various computational techniques are used to control the machine's behaviour. One aspect is the spontaneous generation of walking in legged robots and this can be used to investigate the mechanical requirements for efficient walking in bipeds. This paper demonstrates a bipedal simulator that spontaneously generates walking and running gaits. The model can be customized to represent a range of hominoid morphologies and used to predict performance parameters such as preferred speed and metabolic energy cost. Because it does not require any motion capture data it is particularly suitable for investigating locomotion in fossil animals. The predictions for modern humans are highly accurate in terms of energy cost for a given speed and thus the values predicted for other bipeds are likely to be good estimates. To illustrate this the cost of transport is calculated for Australopithecus afarensis. The model allows the degree of maximum extension at the knee to be varied causing the model to adopt walking gaits varying from chimpanzee-like to human-like. The energy costs associated with these gait choices can thus be calculated and this information used to evaluate possible locomotor strategies in early hominids.},

abstract = {Maximum running speed is an important locomotor parameter for many animals-predators as well as prey-and is thus of interest to palaeobiologists wishing to reconstruct the behavioural ecology of extinct species. A variety of approaches have been tried in the past including anatomical comparisons, bone scaling and strength, safety factors and ground reaction force analyses. However, these approaches are all indirect and an alternative approach is to create a musculoskeletal model of the animal and see how fast it can run. The major advantage of this approach is that all assumptions about the animal's morphology and physiology are directly addressed, whereas the exact same assumptions are hidden in the indirect approaches. In this paper, we present simple musculoskeletal models of three extant and five extinct bipedal species. The models predict top speed in the extant species with reasonably good agreement with accepted values, so we conclude that the values presented for the five extinct species are reasonable predictions given the modelling assumptions made. Improved musculoskeletal models and better estimates of soft tissue parameters will produce more accurate values. Limited sensitivity analysis is performed on key muscle parameters but there is considerable scope for extending this in the future.},

There are multiple reasons why self-organisation should be sought for. Among these, the properties of decentralisation, flexibility, robustness and emergence that pertain to self-organising systems and that are highly desirable for a swarm of autonomous robots (see Section 3.3). However, if everything seems to fit in nicely, the problems arise while trying to design a behaviour that can be considered self-organising. In fact, the features that determine the behaviour of a self-organising system are not explicitly coded anywhere, while the design of a control system requires exactly the definition of behavioural rules for each robot of the system. The design problem - treated in detail in Section 4.1-consists in filling the gap between the desired global behaviour of the robotic system and the individual rules that govern each single robot. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

@article{Trujillo2011,
abstract = {In Evolutionary Robotics, population-based evolutionary computation is used to design robot neurocontrollers that produce behaviors which allow the robot to fulfill a user-defined task. However, the standard approach is to use canonical evolutionary algorithms, where the search tends to make the evolving population converge towards a single behavioral solution, even if the high-level task could be accomplished by structurally different behaviors. In this work, we present an approach that preserves behavioral diversity within the population in order to produce a diverse set of structurally different behaviors that the robot can use. In order to achieve this, we employ the concept of speciation, where the population is dynamically subdivided into sub-groups, or species, each one characterized by a particular behavioral structure that all individuals within that species share. Speciation is achieved by describing each neurocontroller using a representations that we call a behavior signature, these are descriptors that characterize the traversed path of the robot within the environment. Behavior signatures are coded using character strings, this allows us to compare them using a string similarity measure, and three measures are tested. The proposed behavior-based speciation is compared with canonical evolution and a method that speciates based on network topology. Experimental tests were carried out using two robot tasks (navigation and homing behavior), several training environments, and two different robots (Khepera and Pioneer), both real and simulated. Results indicate that behavior-based speciation increases the diversity of the behaviors based on their structure, without sacrificing performance. Moreover, the evolved controllers exhibit good robustness when the robot is placed within environments that were not used during training. In conclusion, the speciation method presented in this work allows an evolutionary algorithm to produce several robot behaviors that are structurally different but all are able to solve the same robot task.},

Some preliminary approaches for combining simulation and reality exist in the ER literature; nonetheless, there is no satisfactory solution available. In this work we discuss recent advances in neuroscience as a motivation for the use of environmentally adapted simulations, which can be achieved through the co-evolution of robot behavior and simulator. We present an algorithm in which only the differences between the behavior fitness obtained in reality versus that obtained in simulations are used as feedback for adapting a simulation.

Accordingly, the interaction between agent and environment, as well as the co-adaptation of artificial brains and bodies, has been the focus of much research in evolutionary robotics. Hence, there are plenty of studies of robotic agents/species adapting to a given environment. Many animals, on the other hand, in particular humans, to some extent can choose to adapt the environment to their own needs instead of adapting (only) themselves. That alternative has been studied relatively little in robot experiments. This paper, therefore, presents some simple initial simulation experiments, in a delayed response task setting, that illustrate how the evolution of environment adaptation can serve to provide cognitive scaffolding that reduces the requirements for individual agents.
