abstract = {The SYMBRION project stands at the crossroads of artificial life and evolutionary robotics: a swarm of real robots undergoes online evolution by exchanging information in a decentralized Evolutionary Robotics Scheme: the diffusion of each individual's genotype depends both on its ability to survive in an unknown environment as well as its ability to maximize mating opportunities during its lifetime, which suggests an implicit fitness. This paper presents early research and prospective ideas in the context of large-scale swarm robotics projects, focusing on the open-ended evolutionary approach in the SYMBRION project. One key issue of this work is to perform on-board evolution in a spatially distributed population of robots. A real-world experiment is also described which yields important considerations regarding open-ended evolution with real autonomous robots.},

abstract = {Abstract. This paper considers the ﬁeld of Evolutionary Robotics (ER) from the perspective of its potential users: roboticists. The core hypothesis motivating this ﬁeld of research is discussed, as well as the potential use of ER in a robot design process. Four main aspects of ER are presented: (a) ER as an automatic parameter tuning procedure, which is the most mature application and is used to solve real robotics problem, (b) evolutionary-aided design, which may beneﬁt the designer as an efﬁcient tool to build robotic systems (c) ER for online adaptation, i.e. continuous adaptation to changing environment or robot features and (d) automatic synthesis, which corresponds to the automatic design of a mechatronic device and its control system. Critical issues are also presented as well as current trends and pespectives in ER. A section is devoted to a roboticists point of view and the last section discusses the current status of the ﬁeld and makes some suggestions to increase its maturity.},

abstract = {Developmental robotics is also known as epigenetic robotics. We propose in this paper that there is one substantial difference between developmental robotics and epigenetic robotics, since epigenetic robotics concentrates primarily on modeling the development of cognitive elements of living systems in robotic systems, such as language, emotion, and social skills, while developmental robotics should also cover the modeling of neural and morphological development in single- and multirobot systems. With the recent rapid advances in evolutionary developmental biology and systems biology, increasing genetic and cellular principles underlying biological morphogenesis have been revealed. These principles are helpful not only in understanding biological development, but also in designing self-organizing, self-reconfigurable, and self-repairable engineered systems. In this paper, we propose morphogenetic robotics, an emerging new field in developmental robotics, is an important part of developmental robotics in addition to epigenetic robotics. By morphogenetic robotics, we mean a class of methodologies in robotics for designing self-organizing, self-reconfigurable, and self-repairable single- or multirobot systems, using genetic and cellular mechanisms governing biological morphogenesis. We categorize these methodologies into three areas, namely, morphogenetic swarm robotic systems, morphogenetic modular robots, and morphogenetic body and brain design for robots. Examples are provided for each of the three areas to illustrate the main ideas underlying the morphogenetic approaches to robotics.},

abstract = {The bootstrap problem is often recognized as one of the main challenges of evolutionary robotics: if all individuals from the first randomly generated population perform equally poorly, the evolutionary process won't generate any interesting solution. To overcome this lack of fitness gradient, we propose to efficiently explore behaviors until the evolutionary process finds an individual with a non-minimal fitness. To that aim, we introduce an original diversity-preservation mechanism, called behavioral diversity, that relies on a distance between behaviors (instead of genotypes or phenotypes) and multi-objective evolutionary optimization. This approach has been successfully tested and compared to a recently published incremental evolution method (multi-subgoal evolution) on the evolution of a neuro-controller for a light-seeking mobile robot. Results obtained with these two approaches are qualitatively similar although the introduced one is less directed than multi-subgoal evolution.},

abstract = {This paper surveys fitness functions used in the field of evolutionary robotics (ER). Evolutionary robotics is a field of research that applies artificial evolution to generate control systems for autonomous robots. During evolution, robots attempt to perform a given task in a given environment. The controllers in the better performing robots are selected, altered and propagated to perform the task again in an iterative process that mimics some aspects of natural evolution. A key component of this process-one might argue, the key component-is the measurement of fitness in the evolving controllers. ER is one of a host of machine learning methods that rely on interaction with, and feedback from, a complex dynamic environment to drive synthesis of controllers for autonomous agents. These methods have the potential to lead to the development of robots that can adapt to uncharacterized environments and which may be able to perform tasks that human designers do not completely understand. In order to achieve this, issues regarding fitness evaluation must be addressed. In this paper we survey current ER research and focus on work that involved real robots. The surveyed research is organized according to the degree of a priori knowledge used to formulate the various fitness functions employed during evolution. The underlying motivation for this is to identify methods that allow the development of the greatest degree of novel control, while requiring the minimum amount of a priori task knowledge from the designer. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Evolutionary Robotics (ER) is a promising methodology, intended for the autonomous development of robots, in which their behaviors are obtained as a consequence of the structural coupling between robot and environment. It is essential that there be a great amount of interaction to generate complex behaviors. Thus, nowadays, it is common to use simulation to speed up the learning process; however simulations are achieved from arbitrary off-line designs, rather than from the result of embodied cognitive processes. According to the reality gap problem, controllers evolved in simulation usually do not allow the same behavior to arise once transferred to the real robot. Some preliminary approaches for combining simulation and reality exist in the ER literature; nonetheless, there is no satisfactory solution available. In this work we discuss recent advances in neuroscience as a motivation for the use of environmentally adapted simulations, which can be achieved through the co-evolution of robot behavior and simulator. We present an algorithm in which only the differences between the behavior fitness obtained in reality versus that obtained in simulations are used as feedback for adapting a simulation. The proposed algorithm is experimentally validated by showing the successful development and continuous transference to reality of two complex low-level behaviors with Sony AIBO1 robots: gait optimization and ball-kicking behavior.},
