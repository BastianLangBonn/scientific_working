abstract = {In the context of cultural computing, we created a mixed reality environment that influences user affect and evokes predefined user behaviour. The theoretical challenge is applying persuasive design to virtual and augmented reality. Based on begin of the story 'Alice's in adventures in Wonderland' users play the role of the character Alice in a park scene (the first stage out of a total of six). The mixed reality environment ALICE is designed for users to experience the same sequence of emotional and behavioural states as Alice did in her quest through surreal locations and events. This particular study addresses the sequential arousal and interdependencies of two drives: boredom and curiosity. Based on literature, we introduce general design guidelines for arousing boredom and explain how boredom can result in curiosity. We report on the design and redesign of the park environment with the entrance to the rabbit hole. In an experiment effectively arousing boredom can be demonstrated. Based on the experimental results we redesigned the park environment. In a second experiment effectively arousing curiosity was shown so that the particular sequence of events (e.g. appearance of the 'White rabbit' robot) had a significant positive influence on the arousal of curiosity and on triggering and guiding intended user behaviour. ?? 2010 International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract = {Higher animals spend a substantial portion of their time and energy on $\backslash$nactivities to which terms like curiosity and play seem applicable (1, 2). An even more conspicuous part of human behavior, especially in highly organized societies, is classifiable as "recreation," "entertainment," "art," or "science." In all of these activities, sense organs are brought into contact with biologically neutral or "indifferent" stimulus patterns - that is, with objects or events that do not seem to be inherently beneficial or noxious. Stimulus patterns en- countered in this way are sometimes used to guide subsequent action aimed at achieving some immediate practical advantage. An animal looking and sniffing around may stumble upon a clue to the whereabouts of food. A scientist's discovery may contribute to public amenity and to his own enrichment or fame. Much of the time, however, organisms do nothing in particular about the stimulus patterns that they pursue with such avidity. They appear to seek them "for their own sake."},

A 33-item questionnaire constructed to assess individual differences in perceptual curiosity was administered to 320 undergraduate students (202 females; 118 males). The participants also responded to the trait scales of the State-Trait Personality Inventory (STPI), and to selected subscales of the Sensation Seeking (SSS) and Novelty Experiencing (NES) scales. Principal axis factor analyses of the perceptual curiosity (PC) items identified a strong PC factor. With oblique rotation, diversive and specific PC components were found, from which subscales were constructed. Moderate positive correlations of the PC scale and subscales were found with the NES and STPI measures of curiosity and the SSS and NES sensation seeking scales, suggesting that perceptual curiosity involves seeking both knowledge and sensory experience. Divergent validity of the PC scale was demonstrated by minimal relationships with the STPI trait anger scale, and essentially zero correlations with the STPI trait anxiety and depression scales. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Experimental results are generally limited to toy scenarios, such as navigation in a simulated maze, or control of a simple mechanical system with one or two degrees of freedom. To study AC in a more realistic setting, we embody a curious agent in the complex iCub humanoid robot. Our novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework consists of a state-of-the-art, low-level, reactive control layer, which controls the iCub while respecting constraints, and a high-level curious agent, which explores the iCub's state-action space through information gain maximization, learning a world model from experience, controlling the actual iCub hardware in real-time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever embodied, curious agent for real-time motion planning on a humanoid. We demonstrate that it can learn compact Markov models to represent large regions of the iCub's configuration space, and that the iCub explores intelligently, showing interest in its physical constraints as well as in objects it finds in its environment.},

Using 5 independent samples, we developed the Curiosity and Exploration Inventory (CEI) comprising 2 dimensions: exploration (appetitive strivings for novelty and challenge) and absorption (full engagement in specific activities). The CEI has good psychometric properties, is relatively unaffected by socially desirable responding, is relatively independent from positive affect, and has a nomological network consistent with our theoretical framework.

abstract = {To autonomously learn behaviours in complex environments, vision based agents need to develop useful sensory abstractions from high-dimensional video. We propose a modular, curiosity driven learning system that autonomously learns multiple abstract representations. The policy to build the library of abstractions is adapted through reinforcement learning , and the corresponding abstractions are learned through incremental slow-feature analysis (IncSFA). IncSA learns each abstraction based on how the inputs change over time, directly from unprocessed visual data. Modularity is induced via a gating system, which also prevents abstraction duplication. the system is driven by a curiosity signal that is based on the learnability of the inputs by the current adaptive module. After the learning completes, the result is multiple slow-feature modules serving as distinct behaviour-specific abstractions. Experiments with a simulated iCub humanoid robot show how the proposed method effectively learns a set of abstractions from raw un-processed video, to our knowledge the first curious learning agent to demonstrate this ability.},

It is argued that theoretical accounts of curiosity proposed during the 1st period fell short in 2 areas: They did not offer an adequate explanation for why people voluntarily seek out curiosity, and they failed to delineate situational determinants of curiosity. Furthermore, these accounts did not draw attention to, and thus did not explain, certain salient characteristics of curiosity: its intensity, transience, association with impulsivity, and tendency to disappoint when satisfied. A new account of curiosity is offered that attempts to address these shortcomings. The new account interprets curiosity as a form of cognitively induced deprivation that arises from the perception of a gap in knowledge or understanding.},

The following statements support our approach: humans are surprised when they perceive something that they did not expect; humans feel desire to learn more (i.e. feel curiosity) about novel (possibly unexpected) objects, usually manifested by focusing the senses on those objects in order to study and analyse them. We describe how external world is internally represented through graph-based representations in our model. In order to accomplish the task of modelling human surprise and curiosity, we describe two main measures: the measure of the difference (or novelty) of an object and the measure of the degree of not expecting an object. Based on these measures, we propose approximate mathematical functions for surprise and curiousity. This approach is illustrated with an example of a perceptual robot that autonomously explores and studies its environment.},

abstract = {Even in absence of external reward, babies and scientists and others explore their world. Using some sort of adaptive predictive world model, they improve their ability to answer questions such as: what happens if I do this or that? They lose interest in both the predictable things and those predicted to remain unpredictable despite some effort. One can design curious robots that do the same. The author’s basic idea for doing so (1990, 1991): a reinforcement learning (RL) controller is rewarded for action sequences that improve the predictor. Here this idea is revisited in the context of recent results on optimal predictors and optimal RL machines. Several new variants of the basic principle are proposed. Finally it is pointed out how the fine arts can be formally understood as a consequence of the principle: given some subjective observer, great works of art and music yield observation histories exhibiting more novel, previously unknown compressibility / regularity / predictability (with respect to the observer’s particular learning algorithm) than lesser works, thus deepening the observer’s understanding of the world and what is possible in it.},

abstract = {The concept of affordances, as proposed by J.J. Gibson, refers to the relationship between the organism and its environment and has become popular in autonomous robot control. The learning of affordances in autonomous robots, however, typically requires a large set of training data obtained from the interactions of the robot with its environment. Therefore, the learning process is not only time-consuming, and costly but is also risky since some of the interactions may inflict damage on the robot. In this paper, we study the learning of traversability affordance on a mobile robot and investigate how the number of interactions required can be minimized with minimial degradation on the learning process. Specifically, we propose a two step learning process which consists of bootstrapping and curiosity-based learning phases. In the bootstrapping phase, a small set of initial interaction data are used to find the relevant perceptual features for the affordance, and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier is trained. In the curiosity-driven learning phase, a curiosity band around the decision hyperplane of the SVM is used to decide whether a given interaction opportunity is worth exploring or not. Specifically, if the output of the SVM for a given percept lies within curiosity band, indicating that the classifier is not so certain about the hypothesized effect of the interaction, the robot goes ahead with the interaction, and skips if not. Our studies within a physics-based robot simulator show that the robot can achieve better learning with the proposed curiosity-driven learning method for a fixed number of interactions. The results also show that, for optimum performance, there exists a minimum number of initial interactions to be used for bootstrapping. Finally, the trained classifier with the proposed learning method was also successfully tested on the real robot.},
