  Abstract                 = {Standard methods for simultaneously inducing the structure and weights of recurrent neural networks limit every task to an assumed class of architectures. Such a simplification is necessary since the interactions between network structure and function are not well understood. Evolutionary computations, which include genetic algorithms and evolutionary programming, are population-based search methods that have shown promise in many similarly complex tasks. This paper argues that genetic algorithms are inappropriate for network acquisition and describes an evolutionary program, called GNARL, that simultaneously acquires both the structure and weights for recurrent networks. GNARL's empirical acquisition method allows for the emergence of complex behaviors and topologies that are potentially excluded by the artificial architectural constraints imposed in standard network induction methods},

The task is to balance a pole that is hinged to a movable cart by applying forces to the cart's base. It is argued that the learning problems faced by adaptive elements that are components of adaptive networks are at least as difficult as this version of the pole-balancing problem. The learning system consists of a single associative search element (ASE) and a single adaptive critic element (ACE). In the course of learning to balance the pole, the ASE constructs associations between input and output by searching under the influence of reinforcement feedback, and the ACE constructs a more informative evaluation function than reinforcement feedback alone can provide. The differences between this approach and other attempts to solve problems using neurolike elements are discussed, as is the relation of this work to classical and instrumental conditioning in animal learning studies and its possible implications for research in the neurosciences.},

An experimental comparisonbetween these three different embryogenies andan evolutionary algorithm with no embryogenyis performed. The problem set to the fourevolutionary systems is to evolve tessellatingtiles. In order to assess the scalability of theembryogenies, the problem is increased indifficulty by enlarging the size of tiles to beevolved. The results are surprising, with theimplicit embryogeny outperforming all othertechniques by showing no significant increase inthe size of the genotypes or decrease in accuracyof evolution as the scale of the problem isincreased},

What determines the organization of cortical maps? We argue that cortical maps reflect neuronal connectivity in intracortical circuits. Because connecting distant neurons requires costly wiring (i.e., axons and dendrites), there is an evolutionary pressure to place connected neurons as close to each other as possible. Then, cortical maps may be viewed as solutions that minimize wiring cost for given intracortical connectivity. These solutions can help us in inferring intracortical connectivity and, ultimately, in understanding the function of the visual system.},

  Abstract                 = {Legged robots show promise for complex mobility tasks, such as navigating rough terrain, but the design of their control software is both challenging and laborious. Traditional evolutionary algorithms can produce these controllers, but require manual decomposition or other problem simplification because conventionally-used direct encodings have trouble taking advantage of a problem's regularities and symmetries. Such active intervention is time consuming, limits the range of potential solutions, and requires the user to possess a deep understanding of the problem's structure. This paper demonstrates that HyperNEAT, a new and promising generative encoding for evolving neural networks, can evolve quadruped gaits without an engineer manually decomposing the problem. Analyses suggest that HyperNEAT is successful because it employs a generative encoding that can more easily reuse phenotypic modules. It is also one of the first neuroevolutionary algorithms that exploits a problem's geometric symmetries, which may aid its performance. We compare HyperNEAT to FT-NEAT, a direct encoding control, and find that HyperNEAT is able to evolve impressive quadruped gaits and vastly outperforms FT-NEAT. Comparative analyses reveal that HyperNEAT individuals are more holistically affected by genetic operators, resulting in better leg coordination. Overall, the results suggest that HyperNEAT is a powerful algorithm for evolving control systems for complex, yet regular, devices, such as robots.},

  Abstract                 = {Artificial neural networks used to be considered only as a machine that learns using small modifications of internal parameters. Now this is changing. Such learning method do not allow to generate big neural networks for solving real world problems. This thesis defends the following three points: ffl The key word to go out of that dead-end is "modularity". ffl The tool that can generate modular neural networks is cellular encoding. ffl The optimization algorithm adapted to the search of cellular codes is the genetic algorithm. The first point is now a common idea. A modular neural network means a neural network that is made of several sub-networks, arranged in a hierarchical way. For example, the same subnetwork can be repeated. This thesis encompasses two parts. The first part demonstrates the second point. Cellular encoding is presented as a machine language for neural networks, with a theoretical basis (it is a parallel graph grammar that checks a number of properties) and a comp...},

  Abstract                 = {This paper compares the efficiency of two encoding schemes for Artificial Neural Networks optimized by evolutionary algorithms. Direct Encoding encodes the weights for an a priori fixed neural network architecture. Cellular Encoding encodes both weights and the architecture of the neural network. In previous studies, Direct Encoding and Cellular Encoding have been used to create neural networks for balancing 1 and 2 poles attached to a cart on a fixed track. The poles are balanced by a controller that pushes the cart to the left or the right. In some cases velocity information about the pole and cart is provided as an input; in other cases the network must learn to balance a single pole without velocity information. A careful study of the behavior of these systems suggests that it is possible to balance a single pole with velocity information as an input and without learning to compute the velocity. A new fitness function is introduced that forces the neural network to compute the velocity. By using this new fitness function and tuning the syntactic constraints used with cellular encoding, we achieve a tenfold speedup over our previous study and solve a more difficult problem: balancing two poles when no information about the velocity is provided as input.},

This paper defines a class of representations called generative representations, which are identified by their ability to reuse elements of the genotype in the translation to the phenotype. This paper presents an example of a generative representation for the concurrent evolution of the morphology and neural controller of simulated robots, and also introduces GENRE, an evolutionary system for evolving designs using this representation. Applying GENRE to the task of evolving robots for locomotion and comparing it against a non-generative (direct) representation shows that the generative representation system rapidly produces robots with significantly greater fitness. Analyzing these results shows that the generative representation system achieves better performance by capturing useful bias from the design space and by allowing viable large scale mutations in the phenotype. Generative representations thereby enable the encapsulation, coordination, and reuse of assemblies of parts.},

It has been suggested that carefully validated simulations with a proper treatment of noise may overcome these problems. This paper reports the results of experiments intended to test some of these claims. A simulation was constructed of a two-wheeled Khepera robot with IR and ambient light sensors. This included detailed mathematical models of the robot-environment interaction dynamics with empirically determined parameters. Artificial evolution was used to develop recurrent dynamical network controllers for the simulated robot, for obstacle-avoidance and light-seeking tasks, using different levels of noise in the simulation. The evolved controllers were down-loaded onto the real robot and the correspondence between behaviour in simulation and in reality was tested. The level of correspondence varied according to how much noise was used in the simulation, with very good results achieved when realistic quantities were applied. It has been demonstrated that it is possible to develop successful robot controllers in simulation that generate almost identical behaviours in reality, at least for a particular class of robot-environment interaction dynamics.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a new method of designing neural networks using the genetic algorithm. Recently there have been several reports claiming attempts to design neural networks using genetic algorithms were successful. However, these methods have a problem in scalability, i.e., the convergence characteristic degrades significantly as the size of the network increases. This is because these methods employ direct mapping of chromosomes into network connectivities. As an alternative approach, we propose a graph grammatical encoding that will encode graph generation grammar to the chromosome so that it generates more regular connectivity patterns with shorter chromosome length. Experimental results support that our new scheme provides magnitude of speedup in convergence of neural network design and exhibits desirable scaling property.},

  Abstract                 = {The reality gap, which often makes controllers evolved in simulation inefficient once transferred onto the physical robot, remains a critical issue in evolutionary robotics (ER). We hypothesize that this gap highlights a conflict between the efficiency of the solutions in simulation and their transferability from simulation to reality: the most efficient solutions in simulation often exploit badly modeled phenomena to achieve high fitness values with unrealistic behaviors. This hypothesis leads to the transferability approach, a multiobjective formulation of ER in which two main objectives are optimized via a Pareto-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm: 1) the fitness; and 2) the transferability, estimated by a simulation-to-reality (STR) disparity measure. To evaluate this second objective, a surrogate model of the exact STR disparity is built during the optimization. This transferability approach has been compared to two reality-based optimization methods, a noise-based approach inspired from Jakobi's minimal simulation methodology and a local search approach. It has been validated on two robotic applications: 1) a navigation task with an e-puck robot; and 2) a walking task with a 8-DOF quadrupedal robot. For both experimental setups, our approach successfully finds efficient and well-transferable controllers only with about ten experiments on the physical robot.},

But this autonomy of design and manufacture has not yet been realized artificially1. Robots are still laboriously designed and constructed by teams of human engineers, usually at considerable expense. Few robots are available because these costs must be absorbed through mass production, which is justified only for toys, weapons and industrial systems such as automatic teller machines. Here we report the results of a combined computational and experimental approach in which simple electromechanical systems are evolved through simulations from basic building blocks (bars, actuators and artificial neurons); the 'fittest' machines (defined by their locomotive ability) are then fabricated robotically using rapid manufacturing technology. We thus achieve autonomy of design and construction using evolution in a 'limited universe' physical simulation2, 3 coupled to automatic fabrication.},

In the inverted pendulum problem, SANE formed effective networks 9 to 16 times faster than the Adaptive Heuristic Critic and 2 times faster than Q-learning and the GENITOR neuro-evolution approach without loss of generalization. Such efficient learning, combined with few domain assumptions, make SANE a promising approach to a broad range of reinforcement learning problems, including many real-world applications.},

  Abstract                 = {The book Enaction, Embodiment, Evolutionary Robotics proposes how a particular kind of simulation model, i.e. Evolutionary Robotics simulations, can help to solve several problems in Cognitive Science. Examples discussed in the book ranges from motor control, neuroscientific theory, social contingency and time perception. It is argued that methodological minimalism can be a merit, not a shortcoming, even when studying something as complex as the human mind. The book concludes by proposing a new minimalist interdisciplinary framework for the study of perception, combining simulation modeling, experimental methods and accounts of subjective experience. This book endorses an enactive and constructivist view on the human mind, in opposition to the traditional information-processing view. Furthermore, the book discusses and presents the enactive approach, clarifies the assets of this view and how it differs from other proposed alternatives to the computationalist paradigm in AI and Cognitive Science, crucial and missing in the ongoing embodied turn. The book also presents new experimental results on a number of topics and points out connections between them. Finally, the book proposes a novel framework for the study of perception that combines a number of methods, including computational modeling, in a previously unseen and promising way.},

Pairs of individuals enter one-on-one contests in which they contend to gain control of a common resource. The winners receive higher relative fitness scores allowing them to survive and reproduce. Realistic dynamics simulation including gravity, collisions, and friction, restricts the actions to physically plausible behaviors. The morphology of these creatures and the neural systems for controlling their muscle forces are both genetically determined, and the morphology and behavior can adapt to each other as they evolve simultaneously. The genotypes are structured as directed graphs of nodes and connections, and they can efficiently but flexibly describe instructions for the development of creatures' bodies and control systems with repeating or recursive components. When simulated evolutions are performed with populations of competing creatures, interesting and diverse strategies and counterstrategies emerge.},

  Abstract                 = {In most modern video games, character behavior is scripted; no matter how many times the player exploits a weakness, that weakness is never repaired. Yet, if game characters could learn through interacting with the player, behavior could improve as the game is played, keeping it interesting. This paper introduces the real-time Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (rtNEAT) method for evolving increasingly complex artificial neural networks in real time, as a game is being played. The rtNEAT method allows agents to change and improve during the game. In fact, rtNEAT makes possible an entirely new genre of video games in which the player trains a team of agents through a series of customized exercises. To demonstrate this concept, the Neuroevolving Robotic Operatives (NERO) game was built based on rtNEAT. In NERO, the player trains a team of virtual robots for combat against other players' teams. This paper describes results from this novel application of machine learning, and demonstrates that rtNEAT makes possible video games like NERO where agents evolve and adapt in real time. In the future, rtNEAT may allow new kinds of educational and training applications through interactive and adapting games.},

  Abstract                 = {Two major goals in machine learning are the discovery and improvement of solutions tocomplex problems. In this paper, we argue thatcomplexification, i.e. the incremental elab-oration of solutions through adding new structure, achieves both these goals. We demon-strate the power of complexification through the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies(NEAT) method, which evolves increasingly complex neural network architectures. NEATis applied to an open-ended coevolutionary robot duel domain where robot controllers com-pete head to head. Because the robot duel domain supports a wide range of strategies, andbecause coevolution benefits from an escalating arms race, it serves as a suitable testbed forstudying complexification. When compared to the evolution of networks with fixed struc-ture, complexifying evolution discovers significantly more sophisticated strategies. Theresults suggest that in order to discover and improve complex solutions, evolution, andsearch in general, should be allowed to complexify as well as optimize.},

  Abstract                 = {An important question in neuroevolution is how to gain an advantage from evolving neural network topologies along with weights. We present a method, NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT), which outperforms the best fixed-topology method on a challenging benchmark reinforcement learning task. We claim that the increased efficiency is due to (1) employing a principled method of crossover of different topologies, (2) protecting structural innovation using speciation, and (3) incrementally growing from minimal structure. We test this claim through a series of ablation studies that demonstrate that each component is necessary to the system as a whole and to each other. What results is signicantly faster learning. NEAT is also an important contribution to GAs because it shows how it is possible for evolution to both optimize and complexify solutions simultaneously, offering the possibility of evolving increasingly complex solutions over generations, and strengthening the analogy with biological evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {This article develops artificial life patterned after animals as evolved as those in the superclass Pisces. It demonstrates a virtual marine world inhabited by realistic artificial fishes. Our algorithms emulate not only the appearance, movement, and behavior of individual animals, but also the complex group behaviors evident in many aquatic ecosystems. We model each animal holistically. An artificial fish is an autonomous agent situated in a simulated physical world. The agent has (a) a three-dimensional body with internal muscle actuators and functional fins that deforms and locomotes in accordance with biomechanic and hydrodynamic principles; (b) sensors, including eyes that can image the environment; and (c) a brain with motor, perception, behavior, and learning centers. Artificial fishes exhibit a repertoire of piscatorial behaviors that rely on their perceptual awareness of their dynamic habitat. Individual and emergent collective behaviors include caudal and pectoral locomotion, collision avoidance, foraging, preying, schooling, and mating. Furthermore, artificial fishes can learn how to locomote through practice and sensory reinforcement. Their motor learning algorithms discover muscle controllers that produce efficient hydrodynamic locomotion. The learning algorithms also enable artificial fishes to train themselves to accomplish higher level, perceptually guided motor tasks, such as maneuvering to reach a visible target.},

  Abstract                 = {Self-reproduction is central to biological life for long-term sustainability and evolutionary adaptation. Although these traits would also be desirable in many engineered systems, the principles of self-reproduction have not been exploited in machine design1. Here we create simple machines that act as autonomous modular robots and are capable of physical self-reproduction using a set of cubes.},
