  Abstract                 = {Evolutionary robotics is a new technique for the automatic creation of autonomous robots. Inspired by the Darwinian principle of selective reproduction of the fittest, it views robots as autonomous artificial organisms that develop their own skills in close interaction with the environment and without human intervention. Drawing heavily on biology and ethology, it uses the tools of neural networks, genetic algorithms, dynamic systems, and biomorphic engineering. The resulting robots share with simple biological systems the characteristics of robustness, simplicity, small size, flexibility, and modularity.In evolutionary robotics, an initial population of artificial chromosomes, each encoding the control system of a robot, is randomly created and put into the environment. Each robot is then free to act (move, look around, manipulate) according to its genetically specified controller while its performance on various tasks is automatically evaluated. The fittest robots then "reproduce" by swapping parts of their genetic material with small random mutations. The process is repeated until the "birth" of a robot that satisfies the performance criteria.This book describes the basic concepts and methodologies of evolutionary robotics and the results achieved so far. An important feature is the clear presentation of a set of empirical experiments of increasing complexity. Software with a graphic interface, freely available on a Web page, will allow the reader to replicate and vary (in simulation and on real robots) most of the experiments.},

  Abstract                 = {For several years now, various researchers have endeavored to apply artificialevolution to the automatic design of control systems for real robots. One of themajor challenges they face concerns the question of how to assess the fitnessof evolving controllers when each evolutionary run typically involves hundredsof thousands of such assessments. This article outlines new ways of thinkingabout and building simulations upon which such assessments can beperformed. It puts forward sufficient conditions for the successful transfer ofevolved controllers from simulation to reality and develops a potentialmethodology for building simulations in which evolving controllers are forcedto satisfy these conditions if they are to be reliably fit. It is hypothesized that aslong as simulations are built according to this methodology, it does not matterhow inaccurate or incomplete they are: Controllers that have evolved to bereliably fit in simulation still will transfer into reality. Two sets of experimentsare reported, both of which involve minimal look-up table-based simulationsbuilt according to these guidelines. In the first set, controllers were evolvedthat allowed a Khepera robot to perform a simple memory task in the realworld. In the second set, controllers were evolved for the Sussex Universitygantry robot that were able to distinguish visually a triangle from a square,under extremely noisy real-world conditions, and to steer the robot toward thetriangle. In both cases, controllers that were reliably fit in simulation displayedextremely robust behavior when downloaded into reality.},

We hypothe-size that this gap mainly stems from a conflict between theefficiency of the solutions in simulation and their transfer-ability from simulation to reality: best solutions in simula-tion often rely on bad simulated phenomena (e.g. the mostdynamic ones). This hypothesis leads to a multi-objectiveformulation of ER in which two main objectives are opti-mized via a Pareto-based Multi-Objective Evolutionary Al-gorithm: (1) the fitness and (2) the transferability. To eval-uate this second objective, a simulation-to-reality disparityvalue is approximated for each controller.  The proposedmethod is applied to the evolution of walking controllers fora real 8-DOF quadrupedal robot. It successfully finds effi-cient and well-transferable controllers with only a few ex-periments in reality.},

  Abstract                 = {Evolutionary  robotics  (ER)  aims  at  automatically  designing  robots  or  controllers  ofrobots  without  having  to  describe  their  inner  workings.  To  reach  this  goal,  ER  re-searchers primarily employ phenotypes that can lead to an infinite number of robotbehaviors and fitness functions that only reward the achievement of the task—and nothow to achieve it. These choices make ER particularly prone to premature convergence.To tackle this problem, several papers recently proposed to explicitly encourage thediversity of the robot behaviors, rather than the diversity of the genotypes as in classicevolutionary optimization. Such an approach avoids the need to compute distancesbetween structures and the pitfalls of the noninjectivity of the phenotype/behaviorrelation; however, it also introduces new questions: how to compare behavior? shouldthis comparison be task specific? and what is the best way to encourage diversity inthis context? In this paper, we review the main published approaches to behavioraldiversity and benchmark them in a common framework. We compare each approachon three different tasks and two different genotypes. The results show that fostering be-havioral diversity substantially improves the evolutionary process in the investigatedexperiments,  regardless  of  genotype  or  task.  Among  the  benchmarked  approaches,multi-objective methods were the most efficient and the generic, Hamming-based, be-havioral distance was at least as efficient as task specific behavioral metrics},

  Abstract                 = {Maximum running speed is an important locomotor parameter for many animals—predators as well asprey—and is thus of interest to palaeobiologists wishing to reconstruct the behavioural ecology of extinctspecies. A variety of approaches have been tried in the past including anatomical comparisons, bone scalingand strength, safety factors and ground reaction force analyses. However, these approaches are all indirectand an alternative approach is to create a musculoskeletal model of the animal and see how fast it can run.The  major  advantage  of  this  approach  is  that  all  assumptions  about  the  animal’s  morphology  andphysiology  are  directly  addressed,  whereas  the  exact  same  assumptions  are  hidden  in  the  indirectapproaches.  In  this  paper,  we  present  simple  musculoskeletal  models  of  three  extant  and  five  extinctbipedal species. The models predict top speed in the extant species with reasonably good agreement withaccepted  values,  so  we  conclude  that  the  values  presented  for  the  five  extinct  species  are  reasonablepredictions given the modelling assumptions made. Improved musculoskeletal models and better estimatesof soft tissue parameters will produce more accurate values. Limited sensitivity analysis is performed on keymuscle parameters but there is considerable scope for extending this in the future.},

  Abstract                 = {Natural DNA can encode complexity on an enormous scale. Researchers are attempting to achieve the samerepresentational efficiency in computers by implementingdevelopmental encodings, i.e. encodings that mapthe genotype to the phenotype through a process of growth from a small starting point to a mature form. Amajor challenge in in this effort is to find the right level of abstraction of biological development to captureits essential properties without introducing unnecessary inefficiencies.   In this paper,  a novel abstractionof natural development, called Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (CPPNs), is proposed.  Unlikecurrently accepted abstractions such as iterative rewrite systems and cellular growth simulations, CPPNsmap  to  the  phenotype  without  local  interaction,  that  is,  each  individual  component  of  the  phenotype  isdetermined independently of every other component.   Results produced with CPPNs through interactiveevolution of two-dimensional images show that such an encoding can nevertheless produce structural motifsoften attributed to more conventional developmental abstractions, suggesting that local interaction may notbe essential to the desirable properties of natural encoding in the way that is usually assumed.},

  Abstract                 = {Research  in  neuroevolution,  i.e.  evolving  artificial  neural  networks  (ANNs)  through  evolutionary  algo-rithms, is inspired by the evolution of biological brains.  Because natural evolution discovered intelligentbrains with billions of neurons and trillions of connections, perhaps neuroevolution can do the same.  Yetwhile neuroevolution has produced successful results in a variety of domains, the scale of natural brainsremains far beyond reach.  This paper presents a method called Hypercube-based NeuroEvolution of Aug-menting Topologies (HyperNEAT) that aims to narrow this gap. HyperNEAT employs an indirect encodingcalled connective Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (connective CPPNs) that can produce con-nectivity patterns with symmetries and repeating motifs by interpreting spatial patterns generated within ahypercube as connectivity patterns in a lower-dimensional space.  The advantage of this approach is that itcan exploit the geometry of the task by mapping its regularities onto the topology of the network, therebyshifting problem difficulty away from dimensionality to underlying problem structure.  Furthermore, con-nective CPPNs can represent the same connectivity pattern at any resolution, allowing ANNs to scale to newnumbers of inputs and outputswithout further evolution.  HyperNEAT is demonstrated through visual dis-crimination and food gathering tasks, including successful visual discrimination networks containing overeight million connections. The main conclusion is that the ability to explore the space of regular connectivitypatterns opens up a new class of complex high-dimensional tasks to neuroevolution.},

  Abstract                 = {A major challenge for evolutionary computation is to evolve phenotypes such as neural networks, sensorysystems, or motor controllers at the same level of complexity as found in biological organisms.  In order tomeet this challenge, many researchers are proposing indirect encodings, that is, evolutionary mechanismswhere the same genes are used multiple times in the process ofbuilding a phenotype. Such gene reuse allowscompact representations  of very complex phenotypes.  Development is a natural choice for implementingindirect encodings,  if only because nature itself uses thisvery process.  Motivated by the development ofembryos in nature,  we define Artificial Embryogeny (AE) as thesubdiscipline  of evolutionary  computa-tion (EC) in which phenotypes undergo a developmental phase.  An increasing number of AE systems arecurrently being developed, and a need has arisen for a principled approach to comparing and contrasting,and ultimately building, such systems.  Thus, in this paper,we develop a principled taxonomy for AE. Thistaxonomy provides a unified context for long-term  research in AE, so that implementation  decisions canbe compared and contrasted along known dimensions in the design space of embryogenic systems.  It alsoallows predicting how the settings of various AE parametersaffect the capacity to efficiently evolve complexphenotypes.},
