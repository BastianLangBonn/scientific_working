  Abstract                 = {Standard methods for simultaneously inducing the structure and weights of recurrent neural networks limit every task to an assumed class of architectures. Such a simplification is necessary since the interactions between network structure and function are not well understood. Evolutionary computations, which include genetic algorithms and evolutionary programming, are population-based search methods that have shown promise in many similarly complex tasks. This paper argues that genetic algorithms are inappropriate for network acquisition and describes an evolutionary program, called GNARL, that simultaneously acquires both the structure and weights for recurrent networks. GNARL's empirical acquisition method allows for the emergence of complex behaviors and topologies that are potentially excluded by the artificial architectural constraints imposed in standard network induction methods},

Although such robustness would be desirable in engineered systems, most machines fail in the face of unexpected damage. We describe a robot that can recover from such change autonomously, through continuous self-modeling. A four-legged machine uses actuation-sensation relationships to indirectly infer its own structure, and it then uses this self-model to generate forward locomotion. When a leg part is removed, it adapts the self-models, leading to the generation of alternative gaits. This concept may help develop more robust machines and shed light on self-modeling in animals.},

  Abstract                 = {Legged robots show promise for complex mobility tasks, such as navigating rough terrain, but the design of their control software is both challenging and laborious. Traditional evolutionary algorithms can produce these controllers, but require manual decomposition or other problem simplification because conventionally-used direct encodings have trouble taking advantage of a problem's regularities and symmetries. Such active intervention is time consuming, limits the range of potential solutions, and requires the user to possess a deep understanding of the problem's structure. This paper demonstrates that HyperNEAT, a new and promising generative encoding for evolving neural networks, can evolve quadruped gaits without an engineer manually decomposing the problem. Analyses suggest that HyperNEAT is successful because it employs a generative encoding that can more easily reuse phenotypic modules. It is also one of the first neuroevolutionary algorithms that exploits a problem's geometric symmetries, which may aid its performance. We compare HyperNEAT to FT-NEAT, a direct encoding control, and find that HyperNEAT is able to evolve impressive quadruped gaits and vastly outperforms FT-NEAT. Comparative analyses reveal that HyperNEAT individuals are more holistically affected by genetic operators, resulting in better leg coordination. Overall, the results suggest that HyperNEAT is a powerful algorithm for evolving control systems for complex, yet regular, devices, such as robots.},

This paper defines a class of representations called generative representations, which are identified by their ability to reuse elements of the genotype in the translation to the phenotype. This paper presents an example of a generative representation for the concurrent evolution of the morphology and neural controller of simulated robots, and also introduces GENRE, an evolutionary system for evolving designs using this representation. Applying GENRE to the task of evolving robots for locomotion and comparing it against a non-generative (direct) representation shows that the generative representation system rapidly produces robots with significantly greater fitness. Analyzing these results shows that the generative representation system achieves better performance by capturing useful bias from the design space and by allowing viable large scale mutations in the phenotype. Generative representations thereby enable the encapsulation, coordination, and reuse of assemblies of parts.},

This paper reports the results of experiments intended to test some of these claims. A simulation was constructed of a two-wheeled Khepera robot with IR and ambient light sensors. This included detailed mathematical models of the robot-environment interaction dynamics with empirically determined parameters. Artificial evolution was used to develop recurrent dynamical network controllers for the simulated robot, for obstacle-avoidance and light-seeking tasks, using different levels of noise in the simulation. The evolved controllers were down-loaded onto the real robot and the correspondence between behaviour in simulation and in reality was tested. The level of correspondence varied according to how much noise was used in the simulation, with very good results achieved when realistic quantities were applied. It has been demonstrated that it is possible to develop successful robot controllers in simulation that generate almost identical behaviours in reality, at least for a particular class of robot-environment interaction dynamics.},

Furthermore, they show reuse of recurring patterns termed network motifs. Little is known about the evolutionary origin of these properties. Current models of biological evolution typically produce networks that are highly nonmodular and lack understandable motifs. Here, we suggest a possible explanation for the origin of modularity and network motifs in biology. We use standard evolutionary algorithms to evolve networks. A key feature in this study is evolution under an environment (evolutionary goal) that changes in a modular fashion. That is, we repeatedly switch between several goals, each made of a different combination of subgoals. We find that such “modularly varying goals” lead to the spontaneous evolution of modular network structure and network motifs. The resulting networks rapidly evolve to satisfy each of the different goals. Such switching between related goals may represent biological evolution in a changing environment that requires different combinations of a set of basic biological functions. The present study may shed light on the evolutionary forces that promote structural simplicity in biological networks and offers ways to improve the evolutionary design of engineered systems.},

This is because these methods employ direct mapping of chromosomes into network connectivities. As an alternative approach, we propose a graph grammatical encoding that will encode graph generation grammar to the chromosome so that it generates more regular connectivity patterns with shorter chromosome length. Experimental results support that our new scheme provides magnitude of speedup in convergence of neural network design and exhibits desirable scaling property.},

  Abstract                 = {The reality gap, which often makes controllers evolved in simulation inefficient once transferred onto the physical robot, remains a critical issue in evolutionary robotics (ER). We hypothesize that this gap highlights a conflict between the efficiency of the solutions in simulation and their transferability from simulation to reality: the most efficient solutions in simulation often exploit badly modeled phenomena to achieve high fitness values with unrealistic behaviors. This hypothesis leads to the transferability approach, a multiobjective formulation of ER in which two main objectives are optimized via a Pareto-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm: 1) the fitness; and 2) the transferability, estimated by a simulation-to-reality (STR) disparity measure. To evaluate this second objective, a surrogate model of the exact STR disparity is built during the optimization. This transferability approach has been compared to two reality-based optimization methods, a noise-based approach inspired from Jakobi's minimal simulation methodology and a local search approach. It has been validated on two robotic applications: 1) a navigation task with an e-puck robot; and 2) a walking task with a 8-DOF quadrupedal robot. For both experimental setups, our approach successfully finds efficient and well-transferable controllers only with about ten experiments on the physical robot.},

  Abstract                 = {In evolutionary computation, the fitness function normally measures progress toward an objective in the search space, effectively acting as an objective function. Through deception, such objective functions may actually prevent the objective from being reached. While methods exist to mitigate deception, they leave the underlying pathology untreated: Objective functions themselves may actively misdirect search toward dead ends. This paper proposes an approach to circumventing deception that also yields a new perspective on open-ended evolution. Instead of either explicitly seeking an objective or modeling natural evolution to capture open-endedness, the idea is to simply search for behavioral novelty. Even in an objective-based problem, such novelty search ignores the objective. Because many points in the search space collapse to a single behavior, the search for novelty is often feasible. Furthermore, because there are only so many simple behaviors, the search for novelty leads to increasing complexity. By decoupling open-ended search from artificial life worlds, the search for novelty is applicable to real world problems. Counterintuitively, in the maze navigation and biped walking tasks in this paper, novelty search significantly outperforms objective-based search, suggesting the strange conclusion that some problems are best solved by methods that ignore the objective. The main lesson is the inherent limitation of the objective-based paradigm and the unexploited opportunity to guide search through other means.},

But this autonomy of design and manufacture has not yet been realized artificially1. Robots are still laboriously designed and constructed by teams of human engineers, usually at considerable expense. Few robots are available because these costs must be absorbed through mass production, which is justified only for toys, weapons and industrial systems such as automatic teller machines. Here we report the results of a combined computational and experimental approach in which simple electromechanical systems are evolved through simulations from basic building blocks (bars, actuators and artificial neurons); the 'fittest' machines (defined by their locomotive ability) are then fabricated robotically using rapid manufacturing technology. We thus achieve autonomy of design and construction using evolution in a 'limited universe' physical simulation2, 3 coupled to automatic fabrication.},

  Abstract                 = {Evolutionary robotics (ER) aims at automatically designing robots or controllers ofrobots without having to describe their inner workings. To reach this goal, ER re-searchers primarily employ phenotypes that can lead to an infinite number of robotbehaviors and fitness functions that only reward the achievement of the task—and nothow to achieve it. These choices make ER particularly prone to premature convergence.To tackle this problem, several papers recently proposed to explicitly encourage thediversity of the robot behaviors, rather than the diversity of the genotypes as in classicevolutionary optimization. Such an approach avoids the need to compute distancesbetween structures and the pitfalls of the noninjectivity of the phenotype/behaviorrelation; however, it also introduces new questions: how to compare behavior? shouldthis comparison be task specific? and what is the best way to encourage diversity inthis context? In this paper, we review the main published approaches to behavioraldiversity and benchmark them in a common framework. We compare each approachon three different tasks and two different genotypes. The results show that fostering be-havioral diversity substantially improves the evolutionary process in the investigatedexperiments, regardless of genotype or task. Among the benchmarked approaches,multi-objective methods were the most efficient and the generic, Hamming-based, be-havioral distance was at least as efficient as task specific behavioral metrics},

  Abstract                 = {This paper surveys fitness functions used in the field of evolutionary robotics (ER). Evolutionary robotics is a field of research that applies artificial evolution to generate control systems for autonomous robots. During evolution, robots attempt to perform a given task in a given environment. The controllers in the better performing robots are selected, altered and propagated to perform the task again in an iterative process that mimics some aspects of natural evolution. A key component of this process–one might argue, the key component–is the measurement of fitness in the evolving controllers. ER is one of a host of machine learning methods that rely on interaction with, and feedback from, a complex dynamic environment to drive synthesis of controllers for autonomous agents. These methods have the potential to lead to the development of robots that can adapt to uncharacterized environments and which may be able to perform tasks that human designers do not completely understand. In order to achieve this, issues regarding fitness evaluation must be addressed. In this paper we survey current ER research and focus on work that involved real robots. The surveyed research is organized according to the degree of a priori knowledge used to formulate the various fitness functions employed during evolution. The underlying motivation for this is to identify methods that allow the development of the greatest degree of novel control, while requiring the minimum amount of a priori task knowledge from the designer.},

Realistic dynamics simulation including gravity, collisions, and friction, restricts the actions to physically plausible behaviors. The morphology of these creatures and the neural systems for controlling their muscle forces are both genetically determined, and the morphology and behavior can adapt to each other as they evolve simultaneously. The genotypes are structured as directed graphs of nodes and connections, and they can efficiently but flexibly describe instructions for the development of creatures' bodies and control systems with repeating or recursive components.

Researchers are attempting to achieve the samerepresentational efficiency in computers by implementingdevelopmental encodings, i.e. encodings that mapthe genotype to the phenotype through a process of growth from a small starting point to a mature form. Amajor challenge in in this effort is to find the right level of abstraction of biological development to captureits essential properties without introducing unnecessary inefficiencies. In this paper, a novel abstractionof natural development, called Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (CPPNs), is proposed. Unlikecurrently accepted abstractions such as iterative rewrite systems and cellular growth simulations, CPPNsmap to the phenotype without local interaction, that is, each individual component of the phenotype isdetermined independently of every other component. Results produced with CPPNs through interactiveevolution of two-dimensional images show that such an encoding can nevertheless produce structural motifsoften attributed to more conventional developmental abstractions, suggesting that local interaction may notbe essential to the desirable properties of natural encoding in the way that is usually assumed.},

The rtNEAT method allows agents to change and improve during the game. In fact, rtNEAT makes possible an entirely new genre of video games in which the player trains a team of agents through a series of customized exercises. To demonstrate this concept, the Neuroevolving Robotic Operatives (NERO) game was built based on rtNEAT. In NERO, the player trains a team of virtual robots for combat against other players' teams. This paper describes results from this novel application of machine learning, and demonstrates that rtNEAT makes possible video games like NERO where agents evolve and adapt in real time. In the future, rtNEAT may allow new kinds of educational and training applications through interactive and adapting games.},

Because natural evolution discovered intelligentbrains with billions of neurons and trillions of connections, perhaps neuroevolution can do the same. Yetwhile neuroevolution has produced successful results in a variety of domains, the scale of natural brainsremains far beyond reach. This paper presents a method called Hypercube-based NeuroEvolution of Aug-menting Topologies (HyperNEAT) that aims to narrow this gap. HyperNEAT employs an indirect encodingcalled connective Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (connective CPPNs) that can produce con-nectivity patterns with symmetries and repeating motifs by interpreting spatial patterns generated within ahypercube as connectivity patterns in a lower-dimensional space. The advantage of this approach is that itcan exploit the geometry of the task by mapping its regularities onto the topology of the network, therebyshifting problem difficulty away from dimensionality to underlying problem structure. Furthermore, con-nective CPPNs can represent the same connectivity pattern at any resolution, allowing ANNs to scale to newnumbers of inputs and outputswithout further evolution. HyperNEAT is demonstrated through visual dis-crimination and food gathering tasks, including successful visual discrimination networks containing overeight million connections. The main conclusion is that the ability to explore the space of regular connectivitypatterns opens up a new class of complex high-dimensional tasks to neuroevolution.},

In order tomeet this challenge, many researchers are proposing indirect encodings, that is, evolutionary mechanismswhere the same genes are used multiple times in the process ofbuilding a phenotype. Such gene reuse allowscompact representations of very complex phenotypes. Development is a natural choice for implementingindirect encodings, if only because nature itself uses thisvery process. Motivated by the development ofembryos in nature, we define Artificial Embryogeny (AE) as thesubdiscipline of evolutionary computa-tion (EC) in which phenotypes undergo a developmental phase. An increasing number of AE systems arecurrently being developed, and a need has arisen for a principled approach to comparing and contrasting,and ultimately building, such systems. Thus, in this paper,we develop a principled taxonomy for AE. Thistaxonomy provides a unified context for long-term research in AE, so that implementation decisions canbe compared and contrasted along known dimensions in the design space of embryogenic systems. It alsoallows predicting how the settings of various AE parametersaffect the capacity to efficiently evolve complexphenotypes.},

  Abstract                 = {An important question in neuroevolution is how to gain an advantage from evolving neural network topologies along with weights. We present a method, NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT), which outperforms the best fixed-topology method on a challenging benchmark reinforcement learning task. We claim that the increased efficiency is due to (1) employing a principled method of crossover of different topologies, (2) protecting structural innovation using speciation, and (3) incrementally growing from minimal structure. We test this claim through a series of ablation studies that demonstrate that each component is necessary to the system as a whole and to each other. What results is signicantly faster learning. NEAT is also an important contribution to GAs because it shows how it is possible for evolution to both optimize and complexify solutions simultaneously, offering the possibility of evolving increasingly complex solutions over generations, and strengthening the analogy with biological evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {This article develops artificial life patterned after animals as evolved as those in the superclass Pisces. It demonstrates a virtual marine world inhabited by realistic artificial fishes. Our algorithms emulate not only the appearance, movement, and behavior of individual animals, but also the complex group behaviors evident in many aquatic ecosystems. We model each animal holistically. An artificial fish is an autonomous agent situated in a simulated physical world. The agent has (a) a three-dimensional body with internal muscle actuators and functional fins that deforms and locomotes in accordance with biomechanic and hydrodynamic principles; (b) sensors, including eyes that can image the environment; and (c) a brain with motor, perception, behavior, and learning centers. Artificial fishes exhibit a repertoire of piscatorial behaviors that rely on their perceptual awareness of their dynamic habitat. Individual and emergent collective behaviors include caudal and pectoral locomotion, collision avoidance, foraging, preying, schooling, and mating. Furthermore, artificial fishes can learn how to locomote through practice and sensory reinforcement. Their motor learning algorithms discover muscle controllers that produce efficient hydrodynamic locomotion. The learning algorithms also enable artificial fishes to train themselves to accomplish higher level, perceptually guided motor tasks, such as maneuvering to reach a visible target.},

  Abstract                 = {Learning and evolution are two fundamental forms of adaptation. There has been a great interest in combining learning and evolution with artificial neural networks (ANNs) in recent years. This paper: 1) reviews different combinations between ANNs and evolutionary algorithms (EAs), including using EAs to evolve ANN connection weights, architectures, learning rules, and input features; 2) discusses different search operators which have been used in various EAs; and 3) points out possible future research directions. It is shown, through a considerably large literature review, that combinations between ANNs and EAs can lead to significantly better intelligent systems than relying on ANNs or EAs alone},
